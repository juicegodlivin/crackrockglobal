# Token Logo Flickering - Fixed ✅

## Problem
Token logos were disappearing intermittently and required refreshing the page to see them again.

## Root Cause
**Race Condition in Data Flow**

The issue was in `useCoinGeckoData.ts` hook:

1. Dashboard loads predictions from API (without `tokenImage`)
2. Hook immediately sets state with these predictions
3. **Images disappear** because enriched data is overwritten
4. Hook then fetches CoinGecko data and enriches predictions
5. Images appear again
6. Any subsequent prediction update repeats this cycle

## Solution

### 1. Preserve Token Images During Updates
**File:** `src/hooks/useCoinGeckoData.ts`

Changed the immediate update effect to preserve existing enriched data:

```typescript
// OLD (causes flickering):
useEffect(() => {
  setEnrichedPredictions(predictions);
}, [predictions]);

// NEW (preserves images):
useEffect(() => {
  setEnrichedPredictions(prevEnriched => {
    // Merge new predictions with existing enriched data
    return predictions.map(pred => {
      const existing = prevEnriched.find(p => p.id === pred.id);
      // Preserve tokenImage and other enriched fields
      if (existing?.tokenImage) {
        return {
          ...pred,
          tokenImage: existing.tokenImage,
          price: existing.price || pred.price,
          volume: existing.volume || pred.volume,
          change24h: existing.change24h || pred.change24h,
        };
      }
      return pred;
    });
  });
}, [predictions]);
```

### 2. Improved Image Loading Reliability
**File:** `src/components/dashboard/PredictionIcon.tsx`

- Removed problematic `crossOrigin="anonymous"` attribute (was causing CORS errors)
- CoinGecko CDN doesn't support CORS headers, so crossOrigin blocks images
- Better error handling with fallback icons
- Simple, reliable image loading
- Background color during load

## How It Works Now

1. ✅ Dashboard loads predictions from API
2. ✅ Hook preserves any existing token images
3. ✅ No flickering - images stay visible
4. ✅ New data fetched in background and merged seamlessly
5. ✅ If CoinGecko image fails, shows themed fallback icon

## Testing

### Before Fix:
- ❌ Images would disappear when navigating
- ❌ Required multiple refreshes
- ❌ Inconsistent image display

### After Fix:
- ✅ Images load once and stay loaded
- ✅ No flickering during page navigation
- ✅ Graceful fallback if image fails to load
- ✅ Smooth user experience

## Additional Features

### Diagnostic Page
Created `/dashboard/diagnostics` to help debug:
- Check if predictions are loading
- Test CoinGecko API status
- View which predictions have images
- See detailed prediction data

## Performance Impact

**Before:** Multiple unnecessary re-renders, images loading repeatedly
**After:** Single load, preserved state, minimal re-renders

Cache duration remains 10 minutes, but images persist in state between cache refreshes.

## Files Modified

1. `src/hooks/useCoinGeckoData.ts` - Fixed race condition
2. `src/components/dashboard/PredictionIcon.tsx` - Improved image loading
3. `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Cleaned up debug logs
4. `src/app/dashboard/diagnostics/page.tsx` - NEW diagnostic tool

## Future Improvements

Consider implementing:
- Image preloading for smoother experience
- Service worker caching for offline support
- Lazy loading for better initial performance
- WebP format support for smaller file sizes
