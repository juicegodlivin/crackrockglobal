# ✅ Deployment Complete - Action Required

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Set Environment Variables NOW

Your code is deploying to Vercel, but **you MUST set these environment variables** for the admin panel to work:

### Go to Vercel Dashboard:
1. Visit: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your `crackrock-v0` (or CrackRock Global) project
3. Click **Settings** → **Environment Variables**

### Add These 3 Variables:

#### Variable 1: ADMIN_PASSWORD
```
Name: ADMIN_PASSWORD
Value: [Choose a strong password - e.g., CrackRock2024!Secure]
Apply to: Production, Preview, Development
```

#### Variable 2: SESSION_SECRET
```
Name: SESSION_SECRET
Value: d4c2fe373c0fe84ff05b7ed0ff89cdaed5b441d5d7775d2ce1c80e5ee4ec7c34
Apply to: Production, Preview, Development
```

#### Variable 3: NODE_ENV
```
Name: NODE_ENV
Value: production
Apply to: Production only
```

### After Adding Variables:
1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Find the latest deployment
3. Click the **⋯** (three dots) menu
4. Click **Redeploy**
5. Select "Use existing build cache" (optional, faster)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If Build Fails:
The build passed locally, so check:
- Vercel build logs for errors
- Environment variables are set correctly
- No quota/limits exceeded

### If Admin Login Doesn't Work:
- Verify `ADMIN_PASSWORD` is set
- Verify `SESSION_SECRET` is set
- Clear browser cookies
- Redeploy after setting variables

### If Dashboard Doesn't Load:
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify `/src/data/predictions.json` deployed
- Check Vercel function logs
- May need to wait for static generation
